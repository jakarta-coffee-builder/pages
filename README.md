# Welcome to Jakarta Coffee Builder

Jakarta Coffee Builder is a project that makes it easy to create Jakarta EE projects in a clean, clear, lightweight and compatible way for all Jakarta EE implementations such as Payara, GlassFish, OpenLiberty, etc.

It was designed to help developers not depend too much on the IDE's capabilities, as it can have limitations depending on the version.

For example, IntelliJ only allows Jakarta EE in the Ultimate version, Eclipse IDE is a bit hard to manipulate, NetBeans generates somewhat outdated code, and Visual Studio Code is very lost.

At the moment we have these two projects:
